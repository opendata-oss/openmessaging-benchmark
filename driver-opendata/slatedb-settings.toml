# SlateDB settings for benchmarking with separate reader

# See https://slatedb.io/docs/operations/tuning/ for available options.

# Flush memtable to L0 SST frequently so separate readers can see data sooner.
# Default is 64 MiB (67108864) - too large for real-time benchmarking.
# Using 256 KB means L0 SSTs are created after ~256KB of writes.
l0_sst_size_bytes = 262144

# Flush interval - how often memtable is written to WAL.
# Default is 100ms which is fine for durability.
